# Rock Paper Scissors
This is an AI simulation to play RPC. It was inspired by a Kaggle competition, to create an RCP playing agent capable of beating human consisitenly.
The model is implemented using Q-learning, a value-based learning algorithm, that updates the value function based on an Bellman equation. The values of the Q table are filled using the MDP's (Markov Decision Process) property.
